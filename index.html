                <h4>Historical of Japan</h4>
                <h2>From Ancient Times to Modern Power</h2>
                <p>
                    Japan's early history dates back to the Jomon period (14,000 BC-300 BC) with a hunter-gatherer
                    society known for pottery. The Yayoi period (300 BC-300 AD) introduced rice cultivation and
                    metalworking, while the Kofun period (300-538 AD) saw the rise of powerful clans. Buddhism
                    arrived in the 6th century, shaping Japanese culture and governance during the Asuka and Nara periods.
                    The Heian period (794-1185 AD) was a cultural golden age.

                    Feudal Japan emerged in the 12th century, with samurai and shogunates ruling. The Tokugawa
                    Shogunate (1603-1868 AD) brought peace and isolation until Western powers forced Japan to open in the
                    mid-19th century. The Meiji Restoration in 1868 led to rapid modernization. Japan became a world
                    power, expanding its empire in the early 20th century but faced defeat in World War II. Today,
                    Japan is a major economic and technological hub.
